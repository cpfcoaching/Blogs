This includes managing risks associated with third-party components, open-source libraries, and any other external code that becomes part of the application. Ensuring the security of these components is crucial because attackers can exploit vulnerabilities within them to compromise the application and the data it processes.</p><p>The core components of source code supply chain security involve identifying, managing, and mitigating risks. Identification entails recognizing all third-party components within your application and understanding their security posture. Management requires implementing policies and tools to ensure that only secure, up-to-date versions of these components are used. Mitigation involves having strategies in place to quickly respond to identified vulnerabilities, such as patching or replacing vulnerable components. This proactive approach helps secure the application and maintains compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.</p><p>Moreover, integrating security practices, known as DevSecOps, is integral to source code supply chain security throughout the development lifecycle. This approach ensures security is considered from the initial design through development, deployment, and maintenance. By prioritizing source code supply chain security within Application Security, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of security breaches, safeguard sensitive data, and maintain trust with their customers. As cyber threats evolve, securing the source code supply chain cannot be overstated, making it a critical component of an organization's cybersecurity strategy.</p><div><hr></div><p>Securing Cloud Assets is a challenge for organizations large and small, but how do you tackle this problem at scale? <br><br>This talk focuses on why this is an enormous problem, why it is challenging (even for mature cloud organizations), and how to solve it in your AWS Cloud environment. <br><br>And yes, even organizations with Cloud Security Posture Management and Cloud Access Security Brokers—yes, you—can learn something from this talk, so head over and check it out.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cpf-coaching.com/securing-cloud-assets-webinar&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Watch Recording Now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}" data-component-name="ButtonCreateButton"><a class="button primary" href="https://www.cpf-coaching.com/securing-cloud-assets-webinar"><span>Watch Recording Now</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2" target="_blank" href="https://www.cpf-coaching.com/securing-cloud-assets-webinar" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png" width="848" height="477" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:477,&quot;width&quot;:848,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:289811,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/png&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:&quot;https://www.cpf-coaching.com/securing-cloud-assets-webinar&quot;,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1514faef-7344-4ba4-8fde-facdd657597f_848x477.png 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><div><hr></div><h2>Book Recommendation</h2><p>Cybersecurity For Business, by Larry Clinton</p><p>In today's digital era, cybersecurity transcends IT.
