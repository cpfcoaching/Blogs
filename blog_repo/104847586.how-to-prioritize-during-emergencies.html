To get a better handle on the situation, try filtering down topics to the one thing that needs to be done. Ask yourself questions like "What is the most important thing to accomplish?", "What needs to be done in the short term?", " What can be put off until a later date?". Once you have identified what needs to be done the most, you can focus on that and prioritize your workload.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to filtering down topics to one thing, it is helpful to list tasks that need to be done. This can help you keep track of your progress and ensure everything is remembered. It can also help to break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable chunks.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Focus on the 80/20 Approach&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The 80/20 approach is a great way to prioritize your workload in times of crisis. This approach focuses on the idea that 20% of your effort will produce 80% of the results. By focusing on the 20% of tasks that will yield the most results, you can maximize your efforts and get the most out of your time.&nbsp;</p><p>When applying the 80/20 approach to times of crisis, it is essential to focus on the tasks that will have the most immediate impact. These tasks should be the first ones on your list. Once they are completed, you can move on to the tasks that will have a more long-term impact.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Learn to Say No</strong></h2><p>When faced with a family emergency, it is crucial to learn to say no. This can help you focus on the most critical tasks in the short term and prevent you from getting overwhelmed. If a task is not essential to the current situation, declining or delaying it is okay. This can help you stay focused and avoid distractions.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to remember that it is okay to ask for help. People are often willing to lend a hand in times of crisis, which can be incredibly beneficial. Feel free to reach out and ask for assistance when needed.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Plan for the Future&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Finally, planning for the future when dealing with a family emergency is crucial. Design and create a schedule to help you manage your workload. This can help ensure that everything is taken care of and help you avoid any last-minute surprises.&nbsp;</p><p>By following the strategies listed above, you can prioritize your workloads in times of crisis and come out ahead. By filtering down topics to one thing, focusing on the 80/20 approach, learning to say no, and planning for the future, you can make the most of your time and stay on top of your workload.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>In Closing</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>When faced with a family emergency, it is natural to feel overwhelmed.
