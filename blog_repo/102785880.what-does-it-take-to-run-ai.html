<p></p><p>The infrastructure required to develop and run AI-driven models for cybersecurity has evolved significantly over the past ten years. It is expected to continue to grow in the next five years. Here is a comparison of the infrastructure needed for AI-driven cybersecurity models from 10 years ago, five years ago, now, and five years into the future:</p><p>Ten years ago:</p><p>Computing power: Ten years ago, the computing power needed to develop and run AI models was significantly less than today. AI models were smaller, simpler, and required less data to train. As a result, organizations could typically run AI models on their existing hardware and did not need specialized infrastructure such as GPUs.</p><div class="paywall-jump" data-component-name="PaywallToDOM"></div><p>Data storage: Ten years ago, organizations typically stored data on-premise, and the amount of data needed to train AI models was significantly less. As a result, organizations did not require specialized data storage infrastructure.</p><p>Networking: Ten years ago, organizations typically had limited networking infrastructure, and cloud services were less widespread. As a result, organizations did not need to consider network security when developing and running AI models.</p><p>Five years ago:</p><p>Computing power: Five years ago, the computing power needed to develop and run AI models had increased compared to ten years earlier but was still lower than today. AI models were becoming more complex but did not require specialized infrastructure like GPUs.</p><p>Data storage: Five years ago, the use of cloud services for data storage was becoming more widespread, but on-premise data storage was still standard. Organizations were starting to store more significant amounts of data, but the need for specialized data storage infrastructure was still limited.</p><p>Networking: Five years ago, organizations were starting to use cloud services more widely, and network security was becoming more of a concern. Organizations were beginning to implement more robust networking infrastructure, but the need for technological security measures was still limited.</p><p>Now:</p><p>Computing power: Today, the computing power needed to develop and run AI models is significantly higher than five years ago. AI models are larger, more complex, and require more data to train, resulting in the need for specialized infrastructure such as GPUs.</p><p>Data storage: Today, the use of cloud services for data storage is widespread, and organizations are storing large amounts of data. This has resulted in the need for specialized data storage infrastructure, including data lakes and cloud-based data warehouses.</p><p>Networking: Today, organizations are using cloud services more widely, and network security is a significant concern. Organizations are implementing robust networking infrastructure and using technological security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and virtual private networks (VPNs) to protect against cyber threats.</p><p>Five years into the future:</p><p>Computing power: In five years, the computing power needed to develop and run AI models is expected to continue to increase, with AI models becoming even more complex. This will likely result in the need for even more specialized infrastructure, including cloud-based GPUs and specialized AI hardware.</p><p>Data storage: In five years, the use of cloud services for data storage is expected to grow, and organizations are expected to store even more significant amounts of data. This will likely result in the need for even more specialized data storage infrastructure, including edge computing and decentralized data storage solutions.</p><p>Networking: In five years, network security is expected to continue to be a significant concern, and organizations are expected to implement even more robust networking infrastructure and security measures. This may include using blockchain technology, secure multi-party computation, and quantum cryptography to protect against cyber threats.</p>
