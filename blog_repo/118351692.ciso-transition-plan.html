This phase will enable the new CISO to hit the ground running, allowing a smoother transition into the role (SANS Institute, 2021).</p><h1>Background research</h1><p>Conducting background research on the company during the pre-onboarding phase is essential. Study existing security policies and programs to understand the current security posture and be aware of any recent security incidents (Gartner, 2020). Learn about the company culture and structure to understand the context in which you will work.</p><p>Start by initiating communication with stakeholders, such as senior leadership and team members. Share your vision and goals for the security program while gathering their insights and expectations. Be cautious not to make any commitments or promises you might be unable to deliver.</p><ol><li><p>Study existing security policies and programs a.

The CISO will thoroughly review the company’s security infrastructure, policies, and procedures and perform a risk assessment to identify vulnerabilities and potential threats (NIST, 2018). Furthermore, the CISO will establish relationships with key stakeholders and department heads to ensure effective communication and collaboration on security initiatives.</p><p>In the first 30 days, assess the security posture by conducting a comprehensive security risk assessment following the NIST Special Publication 800–30 guidelines (NIST, 2018). Identify gaps and vulnerabilities in the existing security infrastructure, processes, and policies.</p><p>Establish a cybersecurity governance framework that aligns with industry best practices, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST, 2021). Ensure adherence to relevant regulations and laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for data privacy in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for data privacy in California (IAPP, 2021).</p><ol><li><p>Study existing security policies and programs a.

In this plan, I will outline the steps to assess the company’s current security posture, identify gaps and weaknesses, and implement best practices to enhance its security program.</p><h1>Assessment:</h1><p>The first step in the transition plan will be thoroughly assessing the company’s current security posture. This assessment will include reviewing the company’s policies and procedures, evaluating its security controls and technologies, and interviewing key organizational stakeholders.</p><p>I will follow the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, a widely recognized standard for managing cybersecurity risk, to conduct this assessment. This framework provides a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity risk management and includes five core functions: identity, protect, detect, respond, and recover. By following this framework, I can ensure that my assessment is thorough, covering all aspects of the company’s security program.</p><h1>Identification:</h1><p>The first core function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is identification, which involves understanding the company’s information assets and the risks they face. In this stage, I will work with key organizational stakeholders to identify the company’s information assets and associated risks. This will include conducting a comprehensive inventory of all hardware, software, and data assets and identifying the people and processes that support these assets.</p><h1>Protection:</h1><p>The second core function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is protection, which involves implementing appropriate safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information assets. In this stage, I will work with stakeholders to review and update the company’s security policies and procedures and implement appropriate technical controls to protect against cyber threats.</p><p>To ensure that the company’s technical controls are adequate, I will follow industry best practices, such as those outlined in the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls, which provide a prioritized set of actions for organizations to improve their cybersecurity posture. For example, I will ensure that the company has implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all accounts, as MFA is one of the most effective ways to prevent unauthorized access to systems and data.</p><h1>Detection:</h1><p>The third core function of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is detection, which involves implementing appropriate controls to identify cyber threats promptly. In this stage, I will work with stakeholders to review and update the company’s incident response plan and implement appropriate technical controls to detect and respond to cyber threats.</p><p>To ensure that the company’s incident response plan is effective, I will follow industry best practices, such as those outlined in the NIST Computer Security Incident Handling Guide. This guide provides a comprehensive framework for incident response and includes detailed guidance on detecting, analyzing, containing, and recovering from cyber incidents.</p><h1>Response and Recovery:</h1><p>The final two core functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework are response and recovery, which involve responding to cyber incidents promptly and effectively and ensuring that the company can recover from these incidents quickly and with minimal disruption. In this stage, I will work with stakeholders to review and update the company’s incident response plan and implement appropriate technical controls to respond to and recover from cyber incidents.</p><h1>Best Practices:</h1><p>Throughout this transition plan, I will follow industry best practices to ensure the company’s security program is effective and sustainable. Some of these best practices include:</p><ul><li><p>Regularly reviewing and updating security policies and procedures to ensure they are aligned with industry standards and best practices.</p></li><li><p>Implementing appropriate technical controls, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software.</p></li><li><p>Conducting regular security awareness training for employees to help them understand the importance of security and how to protect themselves</p></li></ul><p><strong>III. 60 Days</strong></p><p>During the 60-day phase, the primary focus will be developing a prioritized action plan and strengthening incident response capabilities.</p><p>To create a prioritized action plan:</p><ol><li><p>Identify the most critical vulnerabilities based on the risk assessment performed during the first 30 days.</p></li><li><p>Allocate resources to address these high-risk vulnerabilities, focusing on protecting critical infrastructure and sensitive data (Bayuk, 2010).</p></li><li><p>When implementing security controls and processes, ensure they are aligned with the organization’s risk appetite and business objectives.</p></li></ol><p>It is essential to avoid implementing unnecessary or excessive controls, as this could lead to a false sense of security and inefficient resource allocation (Schneier, 2019).</p><p>Strengthening incident response capabilities involves establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) following guidelines provided by the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC, 2021). This team should comprise representatives from various departments, such as IT, legal, and human resources. Developing and testing incident response plans will also be crucial during this phase. This can be achieved by following the guidelines of the ISO/IEC 27035–1:2016 standard (ISO/IEC, 2021). To ensure the effectiveness of these plans, conduct tabletop exercises simulating different cybersecurity incidents and review the outcomes to identify areas for improvement (Pfleeger, 2000).</p><p>During the next two months, the CISO will develop a detailed security roadmap, prioritize improvements, and begin implementing changes to mature the security program. Utilizing frameworks such as NIST Cybersecurity Framework (NIST, 2018) and ISO/IEC 27001 (ISO, 2013), the CISO will create a comprehensive plan to address gaps and improve overall security. This will include initiatives to enhance employee training, improve incident response procedures, and establish a culture of security awareness within the organization.</p><p>In addition, the CISO will establish a continuous improvement process to monitor progress, evaluate the effectiveness of implemented changes, and adjust the security program as needed (ISACA, 2016). This will ensure that the company maintains a proactive approach to cybersecurity and complies with applicable regulations and laws.</p><p>Develop a prioritized action plan:</p><ol><li><p>Address high-risk vulnerabilities a. Focus on critical infrastructure and sensitive data protection (Bayuk, 2010)</p></li><li><p>Implement security controls and processes a. Avoid unnecessary or excessive controls (Schneier, 2019). B. Strengthen incident response capabilities</p></li><li><p>Establish a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) a. Follow guidelines provided by the CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC, 2021)</p></li><li><p>Develop and test incident response plans (ISO/IEC, 2021) a. Conduct tabletop exercises to validate the plan (Pfleeger, 2000)</p></li></ol><p><strong>IV. 90 Days</strong></p><p>In the 90-day phase, the emphasis will be on implementing a security awareness program and continuously monitoring and improving the organization’s security posture.</p><p>Implementing a security awareness program involves training employees on security best practices and policies. As part of the program, conduct regular phishing simulations and tests to evaluate employees’ ability to identify and report potential threats (SANS, 2020). It is important not to blame or shame employees who fail these tests, as this could discourage them from reporting incidents in the future (Hadnagy, 2017). To ensure effectiveness, customize training materials based on job roles and risk levels (SANS, 2020).</p><p>Monitoring and improving the organization’s security posture requires implementing continuous monitoring and improvement processes. Utilize security metrics and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to track progress, inform decision-making, and demonstrate the value of the security program (McGraw, 2006). Regularly update stakeholders on the security program’s progress and challenges to maintain their support and engagement (Kouns &amp; Minoli, 2011). By following this structured approach, the new CISO can successfully mature the company’s security program and establish a strong security posture.</p><p>Develop a prioritized action plan that addresses high-risk vulnerabilities, taking into account the resources and budget available. Implement security controls and processes based on best practices, such as the Center for Internet Security (CIS) Critical Security Controls (CIS, 2021). Only implement security measures if you clearly understand their effectiveness and impact on business operations.</p><p>Strengthen incident response capabilities by establishing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) and developing incident response plans following ISO/IEC 27035–1 (ISO/IEC, 2021). Conduct regular tests and exercises to ensure that the incident response plans are effective and that the team is well-prepared to handle security incidents.</p><p>Implement a security awareness program:</p><ol><li><p>Train employees on security best practices and policies a. Customize training materials based on job roles and risk levels (SANS, 2020)</p></li><li><p>Conduct regular phishing simulations and tests (SANS, 2020) a. Avoid blaming or shaming employees who fail the tests (Hadnagy, 2017). B. Monitor and improve security posture</p></li><li><p>Implement continuous monitoring and improvement processes a. Use security metrics and KPIs to track progress (McGraw, 2006)</p></li><li><p>Report progress to senior leadership a. Regularly update stakeholders on the security program’s progress and challenges (Kouns &amp; Minoli, 2011)</p></li></ol><h1>Summary:</h1><p>The comprehensive transition plan for a new CISO aims to mature the company’s security program by following a structured timeline of pre-onboarding, first 30 days, 60 days, and 90 days.</p><p>During the pre-onboarding phase, the new CISO should conduct background research on existing security policies and programs and understand the company’s culture and structure. This includes reviewing existing documentation and gaining insight into the company’s business operations, risk appetite, and critical stakeholders. Initial communication with stakeholders is crucial, so the CISO should establish relationships with senior leadership and team members and share their vision and goals without making immediate decisions or promises.</p><p>In the first 30 days, the CISO should assess the current security posture by conducting a comprehensive security risk assessment utilizing the NIST SP 800–30 framework. Identifying gaps and vulnerabilities will involve evaluating the maturity of the current security program against industry benchmarks, such as the CIS Critical Security Controls. The CISO should also establish a cybersecurity governance framework by aligning with industry best practices, customizing the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to fit the organization’s needs, and adhering to relevant regulations and laws, such as GDPR and CCPA.</p><p>During the 60-day phase, the primary focus will be on developing a prioritized action plan and strengthening incident response capabilities.
