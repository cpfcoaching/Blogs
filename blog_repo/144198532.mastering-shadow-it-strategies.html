<h6>Explore practical strategies to manage and integrate shadow IT into your secured development processes, to enhance security and compliance without stifling innovation. Learn how MSSPs and security consultants can help your business transform shadow IT challenges into assets for growth and security.</h6><p></p><h2>What is the golden road to secured development?</h2><p>The "Golden Road to Secured Development" refers to integrating security practices throughout the development lifecycle of software and systems to ensure that security is considered at every stage, from design through deployment and maintenance. Achieving this security standard is often described as adhering to a "Security by Design" principle, which involves proactive, comprehensive security integration into the technology environment rather than treating it as an afterthought.</p><p>Shadow IT, comprising IT solutions and systems used without the approval or knowledge of the IT department, can significantly affect a business's journey toward secured development, often referred to as the "Golden Road." Employees using unauthorized software or systems frequently bypass established security protocols and controls, introducing significant vulnerabilities into the organization. These vulnerabilities may compromise the security of sensitive business data and expose the organization to compliance risks, as these solutions may not adhere to regulatory standards. Moreover, shadow IT can dilute the effectiveness of planned IT expenditures and security strategies, as these unauthorized solutions are not accounted for in the strategic planning processes.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg" width="1024" height="1024" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1024,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1096686,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1c086a51-e3fe-4984-b968-972ce8a9e1d8_1024x1024.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container restack-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-refresh-cw"><path d="M3 12a9 9 0 0 1 9-9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1 6.74 2.74L21 8"></path><path d="M21 3v5h-5"></path><path d="M21 12a9 9 0 0 1-9 9 9.75 9.75 0 0 1-6.74-2.74L3 16"></path><path d="M8 16H3v5"></path></svg></div><div class="pencraft pc-reset icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p><p>Businesses aim to achieve this high standard of secured development for several key reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Risk Reduction</strong>: Secure development practices help to reduce the risk of security breaches and data leaks, which can have severe financial, reputational, and regulatory repercussions for an organization.</p></li><li><p><strong>Regulatory Compliance</strong>: Many industries are subject to stringent regulatory requirements that mandate certain security practices. Incorporating these practices from the start of development can ease the compliance burden.</p></li><li><p><strong>Competitive Advantage</strong>: Companies that demonstrate robust security practices often gain a competitive advantage in industries where data security is critical. This is especially true in sectors like finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, where consumer trust is paramount.</p></li></ol><p>Businesses understand that the investment in secured development is not merely a cost but a crucial element of their operational integrity and competitive strategy. This approach aligns with modern security frameworks and best practices, such as those outlined in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks, which advocate for a holistic, risk-based approach to security management.</p><h2>How can Shadow IT Affect this?</h2><p>Shadow IT refers to IT systems, solutions, or software used within an organization without the knowledge or approval of the IT department. This phenomenon can significantly affect the "Golden Road to Secured Development" in several ways:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Increased Security Risks</strong>: Shadow IT introduces a range of security vulnerabilities because the organization’s IT security team has not vetted the hardware or software in use. These unauthorized tools may not comply with the organization’s security policies or standards, which can lead to data breaches or other security incidents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Compliance Issues</strong>: When employees use unsanctioned software or systems, it becomes difficult for the organization to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards. If the organization is found non-compliant during audits, this can lead to severe penalties, including fines and reputational damage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resource Misalignment</strong>: Shadow IT can lead to inefficiencies and wasted resources. Investments in security technologies and systems may not be fully effective if shadow IT systems bypass these security controls. This misalignment can undermine the organization's strategy for secure development and deployment.</p></li></ol><p>Businesses strive to integrate secure development practices into their operations to mitigate risks, ensure compliance, and enhance their competitive position. Adopting a "Security by Design" approach, they proactively embed security into every phase of software development. This reduces vulnerabilities and the potential for data breaches, which can have costly consequences in terms of both finances and reputation. Additionally, secure practices help businesses meet stringent industry regulations and standards, avoiding legal penalties and enhancing trust among customers and partners. In competitive markets, demonstrating robust security practices can also be a key differentiator, attracting clients who value data protection.</p><p>To mitigate the risks associated with shadow IT, organizations can take the following steps:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Increase Awareness and Training</strong>: Educating employees about the risks of shadow IT and the importance of following internal IT guidelines can reduce unauthorized IT usage.</p></li><li><p><strong>Improve IT Service Delivery</strong>: Often, employees turn to shadow IT to fill gaps in the organization's IT services. By improving the responsiveness and flexibility of IT services, organizations can better meet the needs of their users within the security framework.</p></li><li><p><strong>Implement a Formal Process for Technology Approval</strong>: Establishing a straightforward, streamlined process for evaluating and approving technology requests can help ensure that all IT solutions are secure and compliant with company policies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Use Technology to Monitor and Control IT Assets</strong>: Employing tools to discover and manage connected devices and applications across the network can help IT departments identify unauthorized tools and take corrective action.</p></li></ul><p>Addressing shadow IT is crucial for maintaining the security integrity of the development lifecycle and ensuring that the organization's IT investments align with its broader security and compliance objectives.</p><h2>How can we work with the business to integrate shadow IT into the gold road process?</h2><p>To integrate shadow IT into the secured development process effectively, a business needs a structured approach that involves collaboration across various departments. The first step consists of identifying and cataloging all shadow IT resources to understand their organizational scope and usage.
