It adds an <em>extra layer of security beyond just a username and password </em>by requiring an additional verification form, such as an application with a rotating one-time-use token. </p></li><li><p><strong>Cybersecurity Training</strong>: Regular training programs are vital for educating employees about security best practices and the latest cybersecurity threats. This training helps minimize the risk of breaches caused by human error, <em>a leading factor in most security incidents.</em> It also allows users to take this safe security culture from work and implement it in their personal lives. </p></li><li><p><strong>Data Backups</strong>: Maintaining robust data backups is crucial for recovery during a cyber attack. Effective backup strategies involve storing on-site and off-site data and <em>regularly testing these backups</em> to ensure they can be restored successfully.</p></li><li><p><strong>Identity Access Management (IAM)</strong>: IAM involves managing user access to ensure that individuals access technology resources appropriately. This helps prevent <em>unauthorized access to sensitive information</em> and ensures users can only access data necessary for their job functions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Data Classification</strong>: Enforcing data classification standards helps control access to <em>sensitive information based on the level of sensitivity </em>and the necessity of access required by different roles within the organization.</p></li></ol><p>All of these stem from understanding the mission-critical business systems and <em>working with your business leaders to help categorize and prioritize the business systems</em> and processes needed for the business to function and rebuild itself in the event of a disaster. </p><p>To ensure the continuity and resilience of your business operations, it's essential to establish a structured approach to managing and safeguarding mission-critical systems. <strong>Focus on these three pivotal actions to fortify your organization's preparedness and response to potential disruptions:</strong></p><ol><li><p><strong>Conduct Comprehensive Assessments</strong>: Regularly perform business impact analyses and risk assessments to identify and prioritize critical business functions and associated risks.</p></li><li><p><strong>Develop and Test Recovery Plans</strong>: Establish clear recovery objectives and create tiered recovery strategies that are regularly tested and updated to ensure they remain effective and aligned with business needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Enhance Communication and Leverage Technology</strong>: Implement robust communication plans and training programs and invest in technology solutions like cloud services and automated systems to improve resilience and recovery capabilities.</p></li></ol><p></p><p>Subscribe to this <a href="https://substack.cpf-coaching.com">substack</a> and follow me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/christophefoulon/">Linkedin</a> for more helpful information on developing a robust security program. </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.cpf-coaching.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Cybersecurity Leadership &amp; SMB Security Development  is a reader-supported publication.
