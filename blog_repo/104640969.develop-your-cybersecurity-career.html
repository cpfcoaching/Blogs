At the same time, it is gratifying—knowing that what you do makes a difference and, frankly, unmatched job security. The cybersecurity field has many more positions available than qualified candidates.</p><p>Whether you are just starting and are looking for an entry-level position or want to translate many years of experience to the right level, this book will help. In the CISO Desk Reference Guide: Develop Your Cybersecurity Career Path, we’ll show you how to break into cybersecurity at any level. We start at the beginning of your journey and help you determine if this is your right field. Then we give you the tools to conduct a self-assessment to see how you stack up to the area's requirements. After the self-assessment, we transition to your human network and the job search and then guide you into your cybersecurity career.</p><p>Gary has been writing articles and mentoring would-be cyber-warriors for several years. He had selflessly shared every aspect of his journey, from the head-shaking behavior of clueless recruiters to the vulnerabilities of not feeling qualified for the job that would help him provide for his family when he left the military after a long and secure career. Chris and Renee have been hosting a weekly podcast called Breaking into Cybersecurity since September 2019, having met just before then online engaging with the community. The three authors met online, using the same networking techniques they recommend throughout this book.</p><p>Gary, Christophe, and Renee care deeply about their chosen career field and our collective mission. In addition to shepherding their careers, each has been hiring, developing, and mentoring cyber-pros and would-be cyber-pros for years. In Develop Your Cybersecurity Career Path, they each share their perspective about the career, the community, and the commitment and how you can develop your cybersecurity career and land your first cybersecurity job. There is no better way to blend these varied perspectives than to use the tri-perspective storytelling technique that Gary helped pioneer along with Bill Bonney and Matt Stamper, the three amigos that authored the CISO Desk Reference Guide and now publish the CISO DRG catalog of titles.</p><div><hr></div><p></p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://substack.cpf-coaching.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">Cybersecurity Leadership Development Coaching | CPF Coaching is a reader-supported publication.
